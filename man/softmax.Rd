\title{Softmax Function}
\usage{
softmax(array_of_values)
}
\arguments{
\item{array_of_values}{Numeric vector of input values (logits).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length as \code{array_of_values}, where each
element is the softmax of the corresponding input value, representing probabilities
that sum to 1.
}
\description{
Computes the softmax of a given array of values, a transformation often used
in the context of machine learning and statistics, especially for converting
logits to probabilities. This implementation includes numerical stabilization
by shifting the inputs by their maximum value.
}
\examples{
logits <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
probabilities <- softmax(logits)
print(probabilities)
sum(probabilities)  # Should be very close to 1

}
