\title{Compute Attitude Gaps Between Party Positions and Survey Data}
\usage{
compute_attitude_gaps(party_scales_matrix, survey_data, output = "cbind")
}
\arguments{
\item{party_scales_matrix}{A matrix containing the party positions on different scales.
This is expected to be the output from `potgrowth::compute_party_scales`.}

\item{survey_data}{A data frame or list where each element/column represents respondent scores
on the same scales as those in `party_scales_matrix`.}

\item{output}{Character string specifying the output format.
If "cbind", the function returns the `survey_data` combined with the calculated attitude gaps.
Defaults to "cbind".}
}
\value{
Depending on the `output` parameter, this function returns a data frame with the original
        `survey_data` combined with the calculated attitude gaps as additional columns.
}
\description{
Calculates the attitude gaps between party positions on various scales and individual responses
in survey data. This function allows for a comparison of positions on key political or ideological
scales between parties and survey respondents.
}
\examples{
# Assuming party_scales_matrix and survey_data are already defined:
gaps_df <- compute_attitude_gaps(party_scales_matrix, survey_data)
print(gaps_df)
